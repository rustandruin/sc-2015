Matrix factorizations are an important class of linear algebra computations. In this work, we have successfully demonstrated the development and application of a parallel version of CX for a large scale, TB-sized mass-spec imaging dataset. The resulting ion and spatial patterns obtained from the analysis are providing biologist with novel insights on complex molecular mechanisms in cells. 

Spark provides a highly productive platform for expressing complex data analytics algorithms. We have successfully developed a multi-node implementation of Spark, and demonstrated scaling on up to 960 cores. We find that a Spark based implementation is slower than a highly optimized, multi-threaded C implementation by a factor of 20x; we are exploring options to introduce similar optimizations in Spark. Finally, we have run this algorithm on HPC and EC2 class hardware; perhaps unsuprisingly, we find that a faster interconnect enables these numerically intensive computations to run more efficently on HPC systems.
