\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Matrix factorizations are an important class of linear algebra computations
with broad applications in Big Data analytics. In this work, we have
successfully developed highly optimized distributed multi-node
versions of the CX algorithm.
%%, both on a single node, as well as distributed multi-node implementations. 
We use
Spark as a contemporary productive data analytics framework for developing and deploying
the CX algorithm, and successfully demonstrate the implementation scaling up to
960 cores. 
We also implement a close-to-metal parallelized C version that runs 21X
faster than the Spark version on the Amazon EC2 system. Further examination of
this performance gap and its attribution to various components of the Spark
stack will be conducted in the near future. 

Using the Spark version, we evaluate our parallel implementation on HPC and EC2 class
hardware; we find that faster interconnects enable the numerically intensive
computations to run more efficiently on HPC systems. Finally, this scalable
implementation was used to analyze a large TB-sized mass-spec imaging
dataset; the resulting ion and spatial patterns obtained from the analysis are
providing biologists with novel insights on complex molecular mechanisms in
cells.
