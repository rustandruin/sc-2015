\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Matrix factorizations are an important and ubiquitous class of linear algebra
computations. In this work, we have developed a distributed
implementation of the CX algorithm and quantified its performance relative to
an optimized parallelized C baseline, and developed a similarly distributed
implementation of the PCA algorithm. We used Spark, a contemporary data
analytics framework, to develop and deploy our CX and PCA implementations, and
demonstrated that they scale up to 960 cores. We evaluated our Spark CX
implementation on HPC and EC2 class hardware and found that faster
interconnects enable numerically intensive computations to run more efficiently
on HPC systems. The CX implementation was used to analyze a TB-sized mass-spec
imaging dataset; the resulting ion and spatial patterns obtained from the
analysis are providing biologists with novel insights on complex molecular
mechanisms in cells. The PCA implementation was used to analyze a 2 TB-sized
ocean temperature dataset, and has enabled climate scientists to see structures
in the full 3D field that were obfuscated in prior 2D projections. Further
examination of the performance gap of the Spark CX implementation from the
optimized C implementation, and the attribution to various components of the
Spark stack will be conducted in the near future. Likewise, future work
examining the gap between our PCA implementation and more traditional HPC codes
on the platforms considered here will be conducted in the near future.
