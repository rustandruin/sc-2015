In Table~\ref{tab:single_node}, we show the benefits of the
      optimizations described in
      Sec.~\ref{sxn:single_node_opt}.

      %The test matrix $\mathcal{A}$ has {\it{m}} = 1.95M, {\it{n}} = 128K,
      %{\it{s}} = 0.004, and {\it{nnz}} = 10$^9$. The parameter
      %{\it{k}} = 32. 
      As far as single-node performance is concerned, we started with a parallelized implementation  
      without any of the described optimizations. %%, and measured the performance (in terms of time taken). 
      We first implemented the multi-core synchronization scheme, wherein a single copy of the
      output matrix is maintained, %% across all the threads (for the matrix multiplication).
      which resulted in a speedup of 6.5X, primarily due to
      the reduction in the amount of data traffic between 
      the main memory and the caches. 
      %%last-level cache and main memory (there was around 19X measured reduction in traffic). 
      We then implemented our cache blocking scheme, which led to a
      further  2.4X speedup (overall 15.6X).
%%      primarily targeted towards ensuring that the output of the matrix multiplication resides in the caches (since it is
%      accessed and updated frequently). This led to a further 2.4X reduction in run-time, for an overall speedup of around 15.6X.
      We then implemented our SIMD code that sped it up by a further
      2.6X, for an overall speedup of 39.7X. Although the 
      SIMD width is 4, 
        %%($\mathcal{S}$ = 4),
        there are overheads of address
        computation, stores, and not all computations (e.g. the QR decomposition) were
        vectorized.
        %%(QR code is still scalar).



%%     Once the memory traffic was optimized for, we implemented our
%%     SIMD code by vectorizing the element-row multiplication-add
%%     operations (described in detail in Sec.~\ref{sxn:single_node_opt}). 
%%     The resultant code sped up by a further 2.6X, for an overall
%%     speedup of 39.7X. Although the effective SIMD width
%% ($\mathcal{S}$ = 4), there are overheads of address computation,
%% stores, and not all computations were vectorized (QR code is still %% scalar).



        As far as the multi-node performance is concerned, 
 on the Amazon EC2 cluster, with 30 nodes (960-cores in total), and
 the 1 TB dataset as input, it
 took 151 seconds to perform CX computation (including the time to load
 the data into main memory). 
%% and 92 seconds to load the data.
 %read in data into main memory. 
 Compared to the Scala code on the same platform (whose performance is detailed in the next sub-section), we achieve a speedup of 21X.
 %%(in terms of compute time) and 6.7X (data load  + compute time.)
%
 % We did a head-to-head comparison of C code with the Scala node, 
 %%%%implementation on a single node, 
 %and measured a performance gap of around 21X.
 This performance gap can be attributed to the careful cache
 optimizations, maintaining a single copy of the output matrix shared
 across threads, bandwidth friendly access of matrices, and vectorized
 computations using SIMD units.

 Some of these optimizations can be implemented in Spark, such as arranging the
 order of memory accesses to make efficient use of memory. %%of the memory bus.
 However, other optimizations such as sharing the output matrix between threads
 and use of SIMD intrinsics fall outside the Spark programming model, and would
 require piercing the abstractions provided by Spark and the JVM.
 %to more directly access and manipulate the hardware.
 Thus there is a tradeoff between optimizing performance 
 and the ease of implementation %% and efficient global scheduling, 
 provided by expressing programs in the Spark programming model.

  \subsection{CX Performance Using Spark} %% on Spark} across Multiple Nodes}
%  \textcolor{red}{Mike R, Jatin: we need a narrative here}

  \subsubsection{CX Spark Phases}
  The \textsc{RandomizedSVD} subroutine accounts for the bulk of the runtime and all of the distributed computations in our Spark CX implementation.
  The execution of \textsc{RandomizedSVD} proceeds in four distributed phases listed below, along with a small amount of additional local computation.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Load Matrix Metadata}
         The dimensions of the matrix are read from the distributed filesystem to the driver.
      \item \textbf{Load Matrix}
         A distributed read is performed to load the matrix entries into an in-memory cached
         RDD containing one entry per row of the matrix.
      \item \textbf{Power Iterations}
          The \textsc{MultiplyGramian} loop (lines 2-5 of
          \textsc{RandomizedSVD}) is run to compute an approximate basis $Q$
         of the dominant right singular subspace.
       \item \textbf{Finalization (Post-Processing)}
           Right multiplication by $Q$ (line 7 of \textsc{RandomizedSVD}) to compute $C$.
  \end{enumerate}

Fig.~\ref{fig:xc40scaling} shows how the distributed Spark portion of our code scales. %% as we add additional processors.  
We considered 240, 480, and 960 cores.  An additional doubling (to 1920 cores) would be ineffective as there are only 1654 partitions, 
so many cores would remain unused.  
%%%In addition, with fewer partitions per core there are fewer opportunities for load balancing and speculative reexecution of slow tasks.
%%
When we go from 240 to 480 cores, we achieve a speedup of 1.6x: %% from doubling the cores: 
233 seconds versus 146 seconds.  However, as the number of partitions per core drops 
below two, and the amount of computation-per-core relative to communication overhead drops, 
the scaling slows down (as expected).  
This results in a lower speedup of 1.4x (146 seconds versus 102
seconds) from 480 to 960 cores.
%%when we double the core count to 960.

%  \subsection{Timing and Accuracy comparison of RSVD, CX, and truncated SVD}

% Because the RSVD allows us to explicitly control its accuracy by tuning the number of iterations $q$,
% the reconstruction error of the low-rank approximation obtained from the RSVD
% algorithm is expected to be somewhat lower than that of truncated SVD
% approximation. Similarly, CX decompositions have the advantage of
% interpretability, but come at the cost of an increased number of operations on
% top of the RSVD and an additional loss in approximation accuracy. 

%  In Figures~\ref{fig:timing-accuracy-8} and~\ref{fig:timing-accuracy-16}, we observe the timing vs accuracy tradeoffs of the RSVD and CX algorithms
%  as applied to the 100G MSI dataset for two settings of the rank parameter, $k=8$ and $k=16$. The exact SVD was computed in this case using the
%  Spark bindings of the popular ARPACK eigenproblem library~\cite{ArpackUserGuide}. The RSVD algorithm used two power iterations, and we used the output of the RSVD algorithm to generate
%  both the column CX decomposition defined in Algorithm~\ref{alg:cx} and a related `row CX' decomposition that comes from applying Algorithm~\ref{alg:cx}
%  to $A^T.$ As explained in more detail in the next section, both of these CX decompositions are of interest, as they identify important pixels and ions.
%
%  For both rank parameters, we observe the behavior predicted by the theory for the RSVD decomposition: the approximation error is only slightly greater than that of the 
%  truncated SVD approximation. We also observe that there is only a slight speed advantage to using the RSVD; this is likely attributable to the fact that the input matrix
%  is truly low-rank (more than 70\% of the Frobenius norm of the matrix is already captured by the rank-8 decomposition), so the iterative ARPACK SVD algorithm converges 
%  quite fast.
%
%  The CX decompositions require significantly more time to compute than the truncated SVD and RSVD decompositions. This is due to the need to compute the projection of $A$ onto
%  the columns $C$ after $C$ is constructed according to Algorithm~\ref{alg:cx}. We also note that for the MSI dataset, row-based CX decompositions are more 
%  accurate and less expensive to construct than column-based CX decompositions.

  \subsection{Science Results}

      \caption{Normalized leverage scores (sampling probabilities) for $m/z$ marginalized over $\tau$.
        Three narrow regions of $m/z$ account for $59.3\%$ of the total probability mass.}
      \label{fig:cx_ions}
  \end{figure} 

  The rows and columns of our data matrix $A$ correspond to pixels and $(\tau, m/z)$ values of ions, respectively, where $\tau$ denotes drift time and $m/z$ denotes the mass to charge ratio. 
  We compute the CX decompositions of both $A$ and $A^T$ in order to identify important ions in addition to important pixels.
   
  In Figure~\ref{fig:cx_ions}, we present the distribution of the normalized
  ion leverage scores marginalized over $\tau$. That is, each score corresponds
  to an ion with $m/z$ value shown in the $x$-axis. Leverage scores of ions in
  three narrow regions have significantly larger magnitude than the rest. This
  indicates that these ions are more informative and should be kept in the reconstruction basis.
  Encouragingly, several other ions with significant
  leverage scores are chemically related to the ions with the highest leverage
  scores.  For example, the ion with an $m/z$ value of 453.0983 has the second
  highest leverage score among the CX results.  Also identified as having
  significant leverage scores are ions at $m/z$ values of 439.0819, 423.0832,
  and 471.1276, which correspond to neutral losses of $\rm{CH_2}$,
  $\rm{CH_2O}$, and a neutral ``gain'' of $\rm{H_2O}$ from the 453.0983 ion.
  These relationships indicate that this set of ions, all identified by CX as
  having significant leverage scores, are chemically related.  That fact
  indicates that these ions may share a common biological origin, despite
  having distinct spatial distributions in the plant tissue sample.
