We investigate the performance and scalability of the randomized CX low-rank
matrix factorization and demonstrate its applicability through the analysis of
a 1TB mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) dataset, using Apache Spark on an
Amazon~EC2 cluster, a Cray~XC40 system, and an experimental Cray cluster. We
implemented this factorization both as a parallelized C implementation with
hand-tuned optimizations and in Scala using the Apache Spark high-level cluster
computing framework. We obtained consistent performance across the three
platforms: using Spark we were able to process the 1TB size dataset in under 30
minutes with 960 cores on all systems, with the fastest times obtained on the
experimental Cray cluster. In comparison, the C implementation processed the
1TB size dataset 21X faster on the Amazon~EC2 system, due to careful cache
optimizations, bandwidth-friendly access of matrices and vector computation
using SIMD units.  We report these results and their implications on the
hardware and software issues arising in supporting data-centric workloads in
parallel and distributed environments.
