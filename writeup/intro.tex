\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The low-rank approximation to a data matrix $A$ that is provided by performing
a truncated SVD (singular value decomposition) or PCA (principal component
analysis) is a very complicated object compared with
what is conveniently supported by traditional database
operations~\cite{Skillicorn07}. Recall that PCA finds mutually orthogonal
directions that maximize the variance captured by the factorization. The SVD
can also be understood in similar terms, but is often used as a tool for
obtaining low-rank approximations to data matrices, rather than specifically
finding such directions. For this use case, the randomized SVD provides an alternative
to the classical SVD that is more computationally efficient and is guaranteed to 
provide a low-rank approximation with only slightly worse error than the SVD.
Described in more detail in Section~\ref{sxn:low-rank-methods}, the PCA and randomized SVD are
useful in scientific data analysis applications for exploratory data analysis
and for providing compact and interpretable representations of complex
matrix-based data, but their implementation at the terabyte scale in distributed data
analytics frameworks such as Spark remains uninvestigated.

While there are some very large-scale HPC (high-performance computing)
implementations of algorithms for common matrix
problems~\cite{elemental,trilinos,survey-of-large-scale}, these 
require the use of systems-level programming languages; expect fined-tuned control over processors and
communication, e.g., with MPI (message passing interface); lack fault
tolerance; and often do not provide convenient I/O routines. These
implementations are therefore ill-suited to use in multi-purpose scientific 
pipelines. In particular, these implementations do not mesh well with many of
the systems that have become popular recently in large-scale data analysis. 

In this paper, we address the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Can we successfully apply low rank matrix factorization methods such as
    PCA and the randomized SVD to TB-scale scientific datasets in a contemporary data analytics
    framework such as Spark?

  \item What is the performance gap between C+MPI implementations of these
    factorization methods and Spark-based implementations? 

  \item How do Spark-based implementations scale on modern HPC and data-center
    hardware platforms?
\end{itemize}

We start with a description of the matrix factorization algorithms in
Section~\ref{sxn:low-rank-methods}, followed by MPI multi-node
implementation details in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}. We review the
experimental setup for our performance tests in Section~\ref{sec:setup},
followed by results and discussion in Section~\ref{sec:results}.
