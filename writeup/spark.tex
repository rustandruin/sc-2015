\subsection{CX Implementation in Spark}

To support operating on datasets larger than can be stored and processed on a single node,
we implement the algorithms using the Apache Spark cluster computing framework.
%%%
Spark provides a high-level programming model and execution engine for
fault-tolerant parallel and distributed computing, based on a core 
abstraction called \textit{resilient distributed dataset (RDD)}.
RDDs are immutable lazily materialized distributed collections supporting functional
programming operations such as \texttt{map}, \texttt{filter}, and \texttt{reduce},
each of which returns a new RDD.
RDDs may be loaded from a distributed file system, computed from other RDDs,
or created by parallelizing a collection created within the user's application.
RDDs of key-value pairs may also be treated as associative arrays, supporting
operations such as \texttt{reduceByKey}, \texttt{join}, and \texttt{cogroup}.
Spark employs a lazy evaluation strategy for efficiency.
Another major benefit of Spark over MapReduce is the use of in-memory caching and storage so that data structures
can be reused. %% rather than being recomputed.

\subsection{Multi-node Spark Implementation}
\label{sec:cx_spark}
The main consideration when implementing CX %%in a parallel setting 
is
efficient implementations of operations involving the data matrix $A$.
All access of $A$ by the CX algorithm occurs through the
\textsc{RandomizedSVD} routine.
\textsc{RandomizedSVD} in turn accesses $A$ only through the \textsc{MultiplyGramian} and
\textsc{Multiply} routines, with repeated invocations of \textsc{MultiplyGramian}
accounting for the majority of the %%algorithm's 
execution time.

The matrix $A$ is stored as an RDD containing one \texttt{IndexedRow} per row of the input matrix,
where each \texttt{IndexedRow} consists of the row's index and corresponding data vector.
This is a natural storage format for many datasets stored on a distributed or shared file
system, where each row of the matrix is formed from one record of the
input dataset, thereby preserving locality by not requiring data shuffling
during construction of $A$.

We then express \textsc{MultiplyGramian} in a form amenable to efficient distributed implementation
by exploiting the fact that the matrix product $A^TAB$ can be written as a sum of outer products,
as shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:gram}. This allows for full parallelism across the rows of the matrix with
each row's contribution computed independently, followed by a summation step to accumulate the result.
This approach may be implemented in Spark as a \texttt{map} to form the outer products followed by a \texttt{reduce}
to accumulate the results:
\begin{verbatim}
def multiplyGramian(A: RowMatrix, B: LocalMatrix) =
  A.rows.map(row => row * row.t * B).reduce(_ + _)
\end{verbatim}
However, this approach forms $2m$ unnecessary temporary matrices of same dimension as the output matrix $n\times k$,
with one per row as the result of the \texttt{map} expression, and the \texttt{reduce} is not done in-place so it
too allocates a new matrix per row.
This results in high Garbage Collection (GC) pressure and makes poor use of the CPU cache, so
we instead remedy this by accumulating the results in-place by replacing the \texttt{map}
and \texttt{reduce} with a single \texttt{treeAggregate}.
The \texttt{treeAggregate} operation is equivalent to a map-reduce that executes in-place to accumulate the contribution of a
single worker node, followed by a
tree-structured reduction that efficiently aggregates the results from each worker.
The reduction is performed in multiple stages using a tree topology to avoid creating a single
bottleneck at the driver node to accumulate the results from each worker node.
Each worker emits a relatively large result with dimension $n\times k$, so the
communication latency savings of having multiple reducer tasks is significant.
\begin{verbatim}
def multiplyGramian(A: RowMatrix, B: LocalMatrix) = {
  A.rows.treeAggregate(LocalMatrix.zeros(n, k))(
    seqOp = (X, row) => X += row * row.t * B,
    combOp = (X, Y) => X += Y
  )
}
\end{verbatim}
